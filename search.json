    "text": "Driven by the possibility of connecting with others and innovating, Ryan seeks opportunities to collaborate with others to creatively make a positive impact.\n\nThese motivations are evidenced by Ryan’s experience as a sales associate at Top Grills, a leadership mentor for Nebraska Human Resources Institute (NHRI) and the internal vice president of his fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha. These positions have all given Ryan the freedom to come up with new ways to improve the organization he serves, and all share a core goal of making a positive, lasting impact on others. These experiences have led Ryan to value the diversification of education and declare majors in both marketing and sports media and communications.He is interested in applying my diverse strengths and skillset to marketing, branding, entrepreneurship and analytics.\n\nUpper management at Top Grills expressed their quick willingness to trust Ryan with several responsibilities because of my undeniable commitment to find unique ways to improve the customer experience. Additionally, customers gave glaring reviews of his enthusiasm and desire to help. Ryan’s position as a sales associate further developed his interpersonal skills and gave him valuable business and media experience, such as managing a retail store and executing advertisements.\n\nRyan is currently an intern at Gateway Auto, where he supports business operations through data analytics, automation and marketing. He enjoys the way this opportunity allows him to build valuable connections and demonstrate his ability to work with others to innovate.\n\nCliftonStrengths: Empathy | Futuristic | Restorative | Communication | Developer"
